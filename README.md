# Work Timer

A small top window program that shows when to take breaks from work. Inspired by [*No Boilerplate* on Youtube](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4?t=595)

## Installation

Just clone the repository for now. I will make a downloadable package once I got a running version

## Usage

After running the application, you will notice that it does not have an icon in the task bar. Everything is done via the icon-tray. The newly created Icon can be right clicked to reveal three menus. The next lines show what they are doing when clicked:
| Menu Item | Action |
|-|-|
| Set working | Sets the current mode to working |
| Set break | Sets the current mode to break |
| Exit | Exits the program |
